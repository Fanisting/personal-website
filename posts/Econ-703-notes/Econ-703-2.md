##  Delta method (Univariate form)

Extended from CLT: from CLT we know $\sqrt{n}(X_n - \mu) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, var(X_n))$

by continuous mapping theorem we have $\sqrt{n}(g(X_n) - g(\mu)) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, var(X_n)(g'(\mu)^2))$

for any function $g$ which has first derivative, and $g$ should be continuous and $var(X_n)(g'(\mu)^2))$ should be non-zero.

## How to pick a good estimator

Let's say for $\theta$ we wanna propose $\hat{\theta}$ to estimate it. 

Two factors to consider:

- **Closeness**: $\hat{\theta}$  is close to $\theta$
- **Precision**: $\hat{\theta} $ should be precise

### Closeness/Bias

Bias should be:
$$
Bias(\hat{\theta}, p) = \mathbb{E}(\hat{\theta}) - \theta = \mathbb{E}_p(\theta(X_1, X_2, ... X_n)) - \theta(P)
$$

### Precision

variance:
$$
var(\hat{\theta}, p) = var_P[\hat{\theta}(X_1, X_2, ..X_n)]
$$

### Balance Bias and Precision

Use the square loss form (MSE, mean square error):
$$
MSE(\hat{\theta}, p) = \mathbb{E}(\hat{\theta}(X)-\theta)^2 = Bias(\hat{\theta}, p)^2 +var(\hat{\theta}, p)
$$

### Example

Suppose we know $\mathbb{P}(X_i \in [0, 1])$, and define loss function as $L(\mathbb{P}, a) = (a - \theta(\mathbb{P}))^2$

A good estimator can be:
$$
\hat{\theta} = \lambda_n\overline{X_n} + (1-\lambda_n)*0.5
\\
\lambda_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{1+ \sqrt{n}}
$$
This estimator will be better than $\overline{X_n}$ only **since it uses 0.5, which contains information for the distribution** $[0,1]$

## Closeness

Different notation for estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is close to $\theta$.

Generally speaking, the following three are correlated.

- consistent
  - $\hat{\theta} \xrightarrow{P} \theta$ (for all $\theta, P, \theta(P)$)
  - say $\hat{\theta}$ is consistent for $\theta$
- unbiased and the limit
  - $\mathbb{E}(\hat{\theta}) \xrightarrow{} \theta$
  - say $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased and the limit

- asymptotically unbiased
  - $r_n(\hat{\theta} - \theta)\xrightarrow{d}Z$ if $Z = 0$

## Precision
